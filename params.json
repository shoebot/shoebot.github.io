{"name":"Shoebot","tagline":"Coding vector graphics with Python","body":"Shoebot\r\n=======\r\n\r\nShoebot is a Python graphics robot. Instead of drawing with your mouse, you write code to create images. The syntax is simple and aimed at people without a specific programming background -- though its advanced features might be useful for code ninjas too!\r\n \r\nIt takes a Python script as input, which describes a drawing process, and outputs a vector graphic in a common open standard format: SVG, PDF, PostScript or PNG. It works through simple text files, and scripts can describe their own GUIs for controlling variables interactively. It can also be used as a Python module, a plugin for Python-scriptable tools such as Inkscape, and run from the command line without a GUI for automated tasks. \r\n\r\nShoebot is a port/rewrite of [Nodebox 1](http://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Home). It was also inspired by [DrawBot](http://drawbot.com) and [Shoes](http://shoesrb.com/). Thus, \"Shoebot\".\r\n\r\nWhat you need\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nShoebot runs on Python 2.7, which is most probably what you already have installed.\r\n\r\nFirst thing is to install the appropriate dependencies. If this is your first time using Shoebot, you'll want to install all of them:\r\n\r\nDebian/Ubuntu:\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev python-cairo python-gtk2 python-gobject python-gtksourceview2 python-rsvg\r\n\r\nFedora:\r\n\r\n    sudo yum install libjpeg-devel pycairo pygtk2 pygobject2 gnome-python2-rsvg\r\n\r\nOSX:\r\n\r\nWith MacPorts (http://www.macports.org) and python2.5\r\n\r\n    sudo port install py25-numpy -atlas\r\n    sudo port install pango +quartz\r\n    sudo port install librsvg py25-pil py25-cairo py25-gtk\r\n\r\nMacPorts does not have the python-rsvg package, so svg output won't work.\r\nTODO: probably installing py26 packages and gnome-python-desktop would fix the missing python-rsvg problem.\r\n\r\nInstalling Shoebot\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nFor now, the only means of installing Shoebot is getting it from the source repository. Shoebot uses Git for version control. It's available on most major GNU/Linux distributions; fire up your terminal and type:\r\n\r\nUbuntu/Debian:\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install git\r\n\r\nFedora:\r\n\r\n    sudo yum install git\r\n\r\nGentoo:\r\n\r\n    emerge git\r\n\r\nOSX:\r\n\r\n    sudo port install git-core\r\n\r\nMake a temporary directory to download all source files into, and then get the source itself.\r\n\r\n    mkdir ~/src\r\n    cd ~/src\r\n    git clone git@github.com:shoebot/shoebot.git\r\n\r\nYou should now see a new shoebot/ directory. The only remaining step is to install it proper:\r\n\r\n    cd shoebot\r\n    sudo python setup.py install\r\n\r\nOSX:\r\n\r\n    cd shoebot\r\n    sudo /opt/local/bin/python2.5 setup.py install\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning Shoebot from the console\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nUsing the Shoebot console runner is straightforward:\r\n\r\n    sbot inputfile.bot\r\n\r\nThis command will run the 'inputfile.bot' script, and create an output image\r\nfile (output.svg). You'll want to specify your own filename, which can be\r\ndone like so:\r\n\r\n    sbot inputfile.bot -o image.png\r\n\r\nThe allowed extensions for the output filename are .svg, .ps, .pdf and .png.\r\n\r\nYou can find many example Shoebot scripts in `/usr/share/shoebot/examples`.\r\n\r\nShoebot can also run in a window, which is useful for quick previews, as well\r\nas realtime manipulation of parameters. For this, just use the window flag:\r\n\r\n    sbot -w inputfile.bot\r\n\r\nFor a list of extra options, type\r\n\r\n    sbot -h\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nYou can find the current docs at [ReadTheDocs](http://shoebot.readthedocs.org/).\r\n\r\nShoebot documentation can also be generated locally using sphinx. First, install it::\r\n\r\n    pip install sphinx\r\n\r\nThe following commands will output the HTML docs::\r\n  \r\n    cd doc\r\n    make html \r\n\r\nThe documentation should now be available in `doc/build`.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther reading\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nFor a great intro to the Nodebox/Shoebot language, be sure to check the Nodebox tutorials at http://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Tutorial .\r\n\r\nThe Shoebot documentation has quite a lot more information on what you can do with Shoebot, such as:\r\n\r\n  * running Shoebot as a Python module\r\n  * using the socketserver to have other programs control a Shoebot script\r\n  * using Shoebot to generate images via a CGI script\r\n\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n-----\r\n\r\n  * Website:             http://shoebot.net\r\n  * Documentation:       http://shoebot.readthedocs.org\r\n  * Mailing lists:       http://tinkerhouse.net/shoebot/devel\r\n  * Source browser:\t http://github.com/shoebot/shoebot\r\n  * Bug tracker:         http://github.com/shoebot/shoebot/issues\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2007-2012 The Shoebot authors (Stuart Axon, Dave Crossland, Francesco Fantoni, Ricardo Lafuente, Sebastian Oliva)\r\nOriginally developed by Ricardo Lafuente with the support of the Piet Zwart Institute, Rotterdam.\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as\r\n    published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the\r\n    License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
